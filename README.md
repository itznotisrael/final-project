# MEDP33100 - Final Project, Public Archive
    ## Public Archive: *The Anime Memory Vault*

## Live Demo

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on Render.

## Project Overview

- Briefly describe the project and its purpose.

**The Anime Memory Vault** is an interactive public archive where users can submit and preserve meaningful memories connected to anime they’ve watched. The project functions as a shared emotional space — blending user-generated content with a cinematic, animated interface inspired by anime aesthetics, digital memory, and nostalgia.

Users can:
- Enter their name
- Select an anime
- Write a short memory describing a moment that stayed with them
- View all submitted memories in a growing archive
- Sort memories alphabetically
- Delete individual entries

The project explores how personal media experiences can become part of a collective digital archive, emphasizing emotion, memory, and community participation.

## Endpoints

- The project uses a RESTful API connected to MongoDB.
